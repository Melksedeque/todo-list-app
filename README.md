## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

Now I'm gonna focus on JavaScript to make this project better and create new and more complexes projects to develop myself.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap 5.2.3 - Used to create the CSS Grids and to use the preformatated CSS classes in the project instead of rebuild all the CSS Elements.
- [Border_Color](https://css-tricks.com/gradient-borders-in-css/) - Gradient Borders in CSS - This helped me to customize the input borders with gradient colors.
- [Custom_Checkboxes](https://moderncss.dev/pure-css-custom-checkbox-style/) - Customize checkbox - This helped me to customize the checkbox of the list according to the design.
- [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Flexbox - Used to size and position the elements.
